# Install Node Without Local Admin

This repo contains a python script you can run to install node on your local machine. After running the script, it will provide you with a command to copy and paste to update your environment so the "node", "npm", "npx" (etc) commands will work on your terminal.

## Usage

On powershell, run

`(iwr -useb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Carleton-BIT/install-node-noadmin/refs/heads/main/install.py").Content | python -`

FYI: It's quite dangerous to run random scripts you find on the internet. You can trust me, but don't make this a regular thing.
